As you can see there is a folder named pa3. This is the folder that holds all the files that were used to make this project. For context, this was originally a PA for one of my CSE classes at UCSD. It currently still has the tests that checked if everything worked. If you want to reproduce this, you can take all the files and modify the TestSolvers.java file to your desire to see the solving of the maze in action.
